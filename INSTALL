Installation Instructions
*************************


    Termit requires CMake (version  2.4 or later). You can obtain CMake sources here http://cmake.org/.
    
    On Fedora 36: # dnf install cmake gtk+ vte291 vte291-devel lua lua-devel 
    (I also did: # dnf install vte vte-devel; but that may have only made the situation worse)


Run CMake generator:

    cmake .

Then configure termit:

    ccmake .

Then make:

    make

And finally install:

    make install

Package makers can specify DESTDIR:
    
    make install DESTDIR="destdir"

To remove termit:

    make uninstall
